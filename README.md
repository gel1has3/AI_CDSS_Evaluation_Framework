# AI_CDSS_Evaluation_Framework

Based on a Delphi process and a 6-variable evaluation framework, a 28-item measuring instrument for evaluating Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Clinical Decision Support Systems was developed. The full paper is available at Ji, Mengting, et al. "Evaluation Framework for Successful Artificial Intelligenceâ€“Enabled Clinical Decision Support Systems: Mixed Methods Study." Journal of medical Internet research 23.6 (2021): e25929.


We adopted 22 items from the Ji, Mengting, et al.2021 study based on our research protocol and evaluation to assess and evaluate our Clinical Decision Support Systems point of care instrument in resource settings.
