# AI_CDSS_Evaluation_Framework

Based on a Delphi process and a 6-variable evaluation framework, a 28-item measuring instrument for evaluating Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Clinical Decision Support Systems was developed. The full paper is available at Ji, Mengting, et al. "Evaluation Framework for Successful Artificial Intelligenceâ€“Enabled Clinical Decision Support Systems: Mixed Methods Study." Journal of medical Internet research 23.6 (2021): e25929.


We adopted 22 items from the Ji, Mengting, et al.2021 study based on our research protocol and evaluation to assess and evaluate our Clinical Decision Support Systems point of care instrument in resource settings.

We automated the questionnaire, which is now available in both English and Amharic. It is a form of psychometric response scale in which respondents express their level of agreement to a statement in five scores: (1) strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) neutral; (4) agree; and (5) strongly agree. The questionnaire is structured into five sections with a total of 22 questions to validate and measure the instrument's characteristics in the following order: ease of use, system quality, information quality, decision changes, process changes, and user acceptance. 

Furthermore, the assessment is conducted after the expert or health professional has used the CDS- POC instrument. The automated questionnaire tracks the time it takes to complete the questionnaire and filters out disagree, strongly disagree, and neutral responses for further interview to see where CDS-POC solution may improve.
